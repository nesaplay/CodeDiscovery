# CodeDiscovery

Welcome to Code Discovery! This app lets you search for various GitHub discoveries.
Apart from couple details, you can dive into contributors and find out more about them.

I've created a logger saga running in the console so you can follow up with the action flow as it unfolds.

DEMO : [CodeDiscovery](https://nesaplay.github.io/CodeDiscovery/) 

*Notice: I'm using HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter for GH-Pages convenience*
